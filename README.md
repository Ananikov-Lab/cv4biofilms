### Digital biology approach for macroscale studies of biofilm growth and biocide effects with electron microscopy

![cv4biofilms toc](figs/biofilms_toc.png)

Microbial interactions are one of the major topics of current research due to their great societal relevance. However, our understanding of the processes occurring in biofilms is rather limited. A possible method to partly overcome this problem is the implementation of highly efficient imaging and mapping of these structures. This work proposes a combination of automated scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and a comprehensive software system that uses deep neural networks to perform an in-depth analysis of biofilms. Time-dependent, high-throughput mapping of biofilm electron microscopy images was achieved using deep learning and allowed microscale data analysis of visible to the eye biofilm-covered area (i.e., at the macroscale). For this study, to the best of our knowledge, the first matrix and cell-annotated biofilm segmentation dataset was prepared. We show that the presented approach can be used to process statistical data investigation of biofilm samples in a volume, where automation is essential (>70â€†000 separate bacterial cells studied; >1000 times faster than regular manual analysis).

Here, The code for the article "Digital biology approach for macroscale studies of biofilm growth and biocide effects" is presented.

## How to use it?

1. If you want to train your own model, you have to run *./train_network.py*

Example:

```python
python train_network.py --path data/cell_data_3A.pkl --arch_name UNet --encoder_name resnet34 --batch_size 5 --crop_size 896 --optimizer_name Adam --savelogdir test_model_training --elastic_transform_size 5
```
P.S. You can change augmentations during training in *network_training/augmentations.py* 


2. If you want to check test examples, you have to run *test_examples.py*

Example:

```python
python test_examples.py --split test --report_images_output_dir data/test_sample_model_preds --checkpoint_path final_models/final_model.ckpt
```


3. Examples of using the model for SEM images segmentation are shown in *img_analysis_at_scale/large_scale_segmentation.py*, *kinetic_modeling/seg_model_for_kinetic_modeling.py* and *mapping-4-antibiotics-impact/seg_model_for_antibiotics.py*


4. If you want to use cell detection on images, you have previosly to perform image segmentation. After that, you can use function *detect_cells()* from *cell_detection/cell_detection.py*

### Data

All data and networks, used in the research article, are located [here](https://mega.nz/folder/zvhFjIJZ#wjaRa-D1ja6YEa0ZZjl--g)

If you want to run the scripts and jupyter notebooks, it is recommended to locate all necessary files in the *./data/* directory.

It is also recommended to locate all *.ckpt* files in the *./final_models/* directory.
